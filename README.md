Ruby Refresher
===================
Ruby Refresher is the seventh weekend, individual project at Makers Academy. In this weekend we revisited the basics of Ruby.
Specification
-------------

There are 41 questions for which rspec tests are provided. Our task is to write concise, elegant methods that pass the rspec tests (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value).

Languages and Tools
-------------------
* Ruby
* RSpec

How to use
----------
Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:annaschechter/architect-challenge.git
```
Run RSpec to see all tests:
```
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
```
To run a single example, change `it` to `fit` on that example, then run:
```
$ rspec questions_spec.rb --tag focus
```
