## Friday test!

Here we're going to revisit the basics of Ruby. There are 41 questions for which rspec tests are provided. Our task is to write concise, elegant methods that pass the rspec tests (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value).

To run the specs, just run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
~~~

**Quick tip**: to run a single example, change `it` to `fit` on that example, then run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb --tag focus
~~~
